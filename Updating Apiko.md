# Updating Apiko

## Updating the Apiko CLI

The following command will update your Apiko CLI tool version:

`npm up -g apiko-cli`

The CLI tool will always make sure to install the latest Apiko server version in your newly created Apiko projects.

## Updating the Apiko server

If you wish to update the Apiko server version in an existing API project, change directory (`cd`) to the project's root and run:

`npm up apiko`

**Note:** it is necessary to update each Apiko project separately.
